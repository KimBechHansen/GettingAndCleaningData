# GettingAndCleaningData
My solution to Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project

The solution consists of three files:

1. The summary_stats.txt, which holds means for the grouping og Subject and Activity in the dataset
2. A CODEBOOK.md whisch describes all the steps I went through to create the final dataset
3. A run_analysis.R script file, which holds the actual code performing the various transformations from the original data to the filtered/tidy dataset

If any questions - please ask

Enjoy :-)
